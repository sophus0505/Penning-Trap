## Abstract

The aim of this report is to study an idealized version of a device called Penning trap. It is used
by scientists all over the world to investigate charged particles by trapping them long enough to
gather data. We simulate singly charged $Ca+$ ions and explore how the ions interact with each other
inside the trap. In addition, we will analyse two different numerical methods and figure out which
one is best suited to perform the simulations.

When the <code>Makefile</code> is ran, the file <code>plot.py</code> can plot the results written to text files.

We utilized <code>utilities.cpp</code> for writing data regarding the 3D-plots with a header file <code>utilities.hpp</code> for linking.

We also made a <code>test_analytical.py</code> file for testing our methods and implementation.
